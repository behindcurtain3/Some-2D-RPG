Game Engine Tasks
=================

Todo
----

- [] - Allow overriding of some Entity value DefaultOrigin which allows the automatic loader to determine how much displacement to apply.
- [] - Fix issue where entities outside 0 < x > mapWidth (same for y) are not added to QuadTree. Or replace quadtreeeee
- [] - Fix bug in Animation class related to 'IsFinshed()'. Make IGameDrawable classes expose some form of GetCurrentState() enumeration.
- [] - Develop an animation creator/editor so that it doesnt have to be manually specified. Probably best to create this in a seperate repository. Either use QT in order to learn it or some form of WPF.
- [] - Restructure and rethink the idea of ILoadable. AssetManager? How are we going to make this work. *Needs loads of planning.*
- [] - (Bug) Entities at certain zoom levels show pixels from outside their source frame (example Bat and Tree2)
- [] - Add some new monsters to the map, maybe something that walks - in which case start implemeting A* algorithm.
- [Done] - Create PulseLightSource which derives from LightSource. Or allow a specification of a Pulse value in LightSource.
- [Done] - Add Initialise(TeeEngine engine) method.
- [Done] - Automatic conversion of TiledObjects to Entities by TeeEngine. Started work in LoadEntities in TeeEngine.cs
- [Done] - Automatic loading of Entities based on the specified Type. Reflection can then set the properties.
- [Done] - Create some Model View Controller paradigm for controlling Maps with backend code. Specify some 'Model' class to handle a Map in its Property metadata.
- [Done] - Rename 'Objects' Property in TiledObjectLayer to 'TiledObjects'
- [Done] - Add some notes in the wiki about requirements in TiledMaps such as specifying the Content property for each tileset added.
- [Done] - Find a way to place tmx files and tsx files in seperate folders. Problem currently is that they need to reference Content.
- [Done] - Remove EntityLoadCallback from LoadMap. Instead specify a MapLoaded event in TeeEngine that is called everytime a map is loaded using LoadMap.
- [Done] - Investigate imported tileset support (trx files) so that properties etc can be shared amognst multiple maps.
- [Done] - AI for bats. Bats do not really need to make use of A*.
- [Done] - better entity integration in map loading. Finished with LoadEntityCallback in LoadMap method (?)
- [Done] - Add transition capabilities in maps. Example_Map->Cave_Example
- [Done] - Bug when adding more tilesets after the custom sized treetop tileset. This is because the tilewidths do not exceed the images width and height perfectly as expected.
- [Done] - Change *KeyboardExtensions* class to make use of a Dictionary&lt;string, HashSet&lt;Keys&gt;&gt; which should be much faster and scalable.
- [Done] - Implement extended IntersetsWith function. IntersectsWith(Entity entity, GameTime gameTime, string thisGroup=null, string entityGroup=null)
- [Done] - Refactoring of TiledMap namespace to support ILoadable and gracefully transition between Map changes.
- [Done] - Change SpriteBatchExtension 'DrawMultiLineString' to automatically convert strings to mutltiple lines given some maxline length
- [Done] - Create virtual Entity method. ShowDebugInfo (or something like that) that is shown by the TeeEngine when required.
- [Done] - Add support for specifying tile layer 'Color'. For example, the cliff layer could be set to some light gray to give the feeling of distance.

QuadTree / HashList stuff
------------------------

- [] - Create branch for trying out a HashList implementation which could possibly be superior and less buggy than the current QuadTree implementation.
- [] - Improve QuadTree Validate. If a tile isnt contained in a node anymore but STILL interesects it, then no need ot remove it only to re-add it!
- [] - Investigate what is 'slow' in entity updates and updating the bounding box. Is the QuadTree being more ineffecient than effecient?
- [] - Consider converting BoundingBox back to normal Rectangle and making the QuadTree using those instead. Faster.


Must Have
---------

- [Done] - The ability to draw and render a 2D top down game world
- [Done] - an entity framework
- [Done] - an animation framework
- [Done] - a post-rendering shader framework
- [Done] - the ability to load from tiled maps (prevents from having to develop a map creation application)

Should Have
-----------
- [] - Ability to run in full screen mode. Currently this does not work as expected.
- [] - The ability to allow the player to change between various armor sets, weapons, hair styles, gender etc... just like an RPG.
- [] - NPC Interaction (scriptable with dialog text)
- [] - ICollision interface should be implemented and used by the QuadTreeNode to allow extensions to be added.
- [Done] - the ability to zoom in and out (scale)
- [Done] - an effecient collision detection engine (QuadTree)
- [] - a per entity / per tile shader framework
- [] - an application to be able to design animations and speficy frames (however try look into alternatives such as texture compressor)
  - try out QT in the case where an application will be designed from scratch
- [] - an Asset management system for loading and unloading items in and out of memory
- [Done] - Map scripting in the form of python, lua or external C#. Need to do research to see which one is the best to use. Make sure to consider **performance**, **ease of use**, **support** and **stability of package**.
       - example: http://www.gamedev.net/page/resources/_/technical/game-programming/using-lua-with-c-r2275 *LUA*
       - example: http://mail.python.org/pipermail/pythondotnet/2003-November/000037.html *PYTHON*
       - example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/826398/is-it-possible-to-dynamically-compile-and-execute-c-sharp-code-fragments *C#*
- [] - Animated tile support. This is currently a bit hard in Tiled, but hopefully [support for specifying animated tiles will come soon](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/57#issuecomment-16699982)
- [Done] - Composite drawing support in entities (allowing entities to make use of more than one animation at one go)
- [Done] - Detailed diagnostic information in terms of performance counters
- [Done] - the ability to reset animations

Nice to Have
------------

- [] - Support for loading Image layers specified in tiled files.
- [] - zlib compression support in tmx files
- [] - the ability to pause and resume the state of the world from within the engine itself
- [] - the ability to run on MonoGame
